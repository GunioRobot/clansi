== CLANSI ==

Some ANSI text output helper functions for Clojure terminal programs.

Wrap strings in ANSI color and style codes like this:

(style "foo bar" :red)

(style "foo bar" :underline)

(style "foo bar" :blue :bg-red :underline)

=== Bonus Features: ===

* call (clansi/colorize-docs) to make doc colorized
* also supplies the color-doc macro, a stylized version of doc
